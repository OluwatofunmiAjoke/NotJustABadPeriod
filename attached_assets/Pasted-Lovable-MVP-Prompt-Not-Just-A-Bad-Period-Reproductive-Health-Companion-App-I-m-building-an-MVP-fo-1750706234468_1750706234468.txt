Lovable MVP Prompt: Not Just A Bad Period – Reproductive Health Companion App
I’m building an MVP for a mobile/web app called Not Just A Bad Period.
It’s a reproductive health companion for African and Afro-diaspora women living with chronic conditions like endometriosis, PCOS, fibroids, adenomyosis, and infertility — with a faith-aware and culturally sensitive approach.

This app is for users who are often dismissed, misdiagnosed, and overwhelmed. It should feel like a gentle, smart, life-saving assistant — not a cold medical form.

🎯 MVP GOALS:
Build an app that helps users:

Track symptoms, medications, and medical history

Generate reports for doctors and appointments

Identify patterns to support better decisions

Manage energy levels and life tasks around their health

Do all this in a calm, private, and faith-informed space
